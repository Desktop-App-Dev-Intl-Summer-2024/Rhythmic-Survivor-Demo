# Rhythmic-Survivor-Demo

This project is a rhythmic game, which is a type of game where the main mechanic is for the player to do an action following the music rhythm. The game will have a single-survival level, different waves of enemies with unique patterns that will increase in quantity and endurance, and a single player with three different weapons that will also increase their effectiveness. The game will save the player’s personal information to log in and access the progress, in a database also containing the enemies and music data. The main software to build out the game will be Unity for visual and structural development.
